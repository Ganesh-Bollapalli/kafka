The broker uses message partitioning strategy storing each partition in the corresponding broker in a cluster

Fetch requests are constantly sent by the follower replicas to the leader to consume recent messages. The request contains an offset of the message the replica wants to receive. 
The leader responds to the request with a message at that offset.

A replica is considered out of sync when it fails to update with recent messages within 10 seconds and loses credibility 
to become a leader in the event of some failures with the current leader in the cluster.

These are the minimum set of replicas that ought to be in sync with the lead replica whenever there is a change in the lead replica.

To elect the new leader, all the follower ISRs register themselves with the Zookeeper.


Metadata Requests are sent both by the Producer and Consumer to any broker and contain a list of topics it is interested in.
The broker will respond to metadata request with the partitions of the topic, replicas for the partition, and the leader replica


Produce requests are sent from the producer application and contain messages that need to be written to the Broker.
The Producer sends these requests only to the leader replica. Otherwise, it will receive an error response saying "Not a Leader for Partition".
The Producer could send these requests to the leader replica of a partition, by sending metadata request to any broker.
If the privilege is available, it will write the data and check 'ack' (acknowledgment configuration).


Fetch requests are sent by the consumer to Broker to read messages from an offset of a topic's leader partition. It is also used among Brokers to replicate partitions.
The client sends an upper limit (maximum amount of data the client can accept from the broker), and a lower limit (minimum amount of data needed for a data transfer to happen)
